# Spark-ml-algo-lib



Introduction
============

The machine learning algorithm library running on Kunpeng processors is an acceleration library that provides a rich set of high-level tools for machine learning algorithms. It is based on the original APIs of Apache [Spark 2.4.6](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/v2.4.6), [breeze 0.13.1](https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/tree/releases/v0.13.1) and [xgboost 1.1.0](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/release_1.0.0). The acceleration library for greatly improves the computing power in big data scenarios.

The library provides eighteen machine learning algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), random forest classifier (RFC), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), decision tree (DT), K-means clustering, linear regression, logistic regression algorithm, principal component analysis (PCA), singular value decomposition (SVD), latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), prefix-projected pattern prowth (Prefix-Span), alternating least squares (ALS), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Covariance, Density-based spatial clustering of applicaitons with noise (DBSCAN), Pearson, Spearman, and XGboost.
